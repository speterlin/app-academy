# Snake

We're going to write a Snake game!

## Phase I: `Snake` and `Board`

* Write your code in a `snake.js` file (with appropriate namespace).
* Write a `Snake` class
    * Store the `dir` of the snake. I made this one char
      (`["N", "E", "S", "W"]`).
    * Store the `segments` of the snake. I stored grid coordinates.
    * I wrote a simple `Coord` class. It had utility methods `plus`,
      `equals`, and `isOpposite`.
      * An alternative would be writing helper methods that take two
        array arguments.
    * Write a `Snake#move` function that will move the snake in the
      current direction.
    * I wrote a simple `turn` method that took a new direction and
      updated `dir`.
* Write a `Board` class.
    * The board should construct and hold a `Snake`.
    * Later, your `Board` can hold on to the apples that are on the
      board.
    * Write a simple `Board#render` method that renders the board to
      ASCII art. I used `"."` for blank spaces and `"S"` for spaces
      the snake occupied.

## Phase II: Write a simple `View` class

* Write your UI code in a `snake-view.js` file. Use the same
  namespace.
    * **Do not mix UI into your model layer**. Keep `snake.js`
      agnostic of the code that displays the game, or that listens for
      browser events.
* Write a `View` class that takes in an HTML element which will hold
  the display. Save this in a `$el` instance variable.
* In the constructor, build a `Board`.
* In the constructor, bind a listener to detect key events, so you
  know when the user wants to turn the snake.
    * I used jQuery's `on` method with event `"keydown"`.
    * Lookup and read the relevant jQuery docs as needed.
    * I wrote a helper method `handleKeyEvent(event)`. It looked up
      `event.keyCode` and passed the appropriate direction to
      `Snake#turn`.
* In the constructor, also use `setInterval` to run a `#step` method
  every half second. Each turn it should call `Snake#move` and redraws
  the whole board.
* To draw the board, I just set the HTML contents of the root element
  to the result of `Board#render`. This ASCII art version works fine
  if you use a `pre` tag.

## Phase III: On your own!

* Change how you render the board. Instead of ASCII art, use divs with
  CSS classes.
    * As before, I would redraw the board each turn.
* Add apples to the game. When a snake eats an apple, it grows (for a
  few moves). Randomly generate apples every several turns.
* Detect when a snake hits itself. You lose!

## Phase IV: Bonus!

Many of you will finish the basic functionality with time to
spare. Here are some fun things you can add:

* Keep score (10 points for each apple eaten)
* Pause and restart game
* Leaderboard (keep high scores)
    * Note that you won't be able to store scores across loads of the
      game.
* Tron Snake: 2 player snake (use the 'wasd' keys for one and arrow
  keys for the other) with both snakes running at the same time.

Feel free to come up with extensions of your own. Have fun with it
(and show off to your classmates)!
