# Week 6, Day 2 - JavaScript
## Overview
### What we will cover today:
* JavaScript fundementals
* Functional programming
* Object orientation
* Classes and constructors
* Prototypes

## Projects
### 1) Javascript Problems
We will redo several of the Ruby methods we implemented before, but this time in JavaScript. These shouldn't take you too long since you already know the logic behind them.
* Arrays
  * Remove duplicates
  * Find two-sums
  * Traspose a matrix
* Enumerables
  * Multiply elements in array by two
  * 'my_each'
  * Inject
* Iteration
  * Bubble sort
  * Substrings
* Recursion
  * Range
  * Array sum
  * Exponent
  * Fibonacci
  * Binary Search
  * Make change
  * Merge sort

### 2) Towers of Hanoi
The Towers of Hanoi game we built in Ruby, but this time in JavaScript. Same gameplay as before.

### 3) Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe. Pretty self-explanatory. Don't worry about AI.
