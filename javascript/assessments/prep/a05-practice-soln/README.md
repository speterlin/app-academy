# JavaScript Assessment - practice
**Windows Users**: Please use one of our workstation machines for the assessments.

This assessment aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic
and intermediate features.

Topics covered:

  * Basic syntax: function declarations, objects, etc.
  * Prototypal inheritance
  * Module pattern

You have 1 hour. The specs live in the `spec/` directory. Your code
should go in the `src/` directory in the files provided. All your
functions should be namespaced under `Assessment`.

How to run the specs: open up `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.
