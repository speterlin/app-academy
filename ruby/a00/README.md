# Assessment00a Instructions

**Do not share this repo or post it publicly. We will take violations
very seriously.**

This assessment consists of four problems to complete in one hour. The
assessment is meant to challenge you. Do not worry if you do not
complete all the assessment; do the best you can. Do not take more
than one hour.

The instructions for the practice problems are written inside the spec
files (in the `spec` directory); check those for instructions on what
you are supposed to do. You can run the specs for an individual
problem like so:

    bundle exec rspec spec/00_digital_root_spec.rb

You can write your code in the corresponding files in `lib` (e.g.,
`lib/00_digital_root.rb`). I've filled them out with a blank method
for you. You'll need to write the code to make the specs pass.

Work through the problems one by one; when you complete writing the
code, run the spec to check your work. Make sure to look at the
results it returns; look at which individual tests fail and then start
to figure out why.

Finally, submit your solution by submitting a ZIPped copy of the
assessment folder (including both specs and lib). Upload this file
to the same page that you downloaded it from on progress.appacademy.io.
